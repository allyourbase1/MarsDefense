# MarsDefense
An endless runner type space shooter made in 68000 Assembly

Take control of one of the fastest ships in the universe!
Which sounds great and all but it's tough to successfully navigate with such speed!
Fly with precision, survive as long as you can, and take out as many enemy ships as possible before you are overwhelmed by the endless onslaught of alien ships!

WASD to move and Spacebar to fire
